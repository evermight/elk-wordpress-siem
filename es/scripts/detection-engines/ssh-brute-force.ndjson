Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n","license":"Elastic License v2","output_index":"","meta":{"from":"4m","kibana_siem_app_url":""},"author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":[],"from":"now-540s","rule_id":"546730be-aad0-491b-baa5-a6fd7beaed01","max_signals":100,"risk_score_mapping":[],"severity_mapping":[],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0006","name":"Credential Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1110","name":"Brute Force","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1110.001","name":"Password Guessing","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001/"},{"id":"T1110.003","name":"Password Spraying","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/"}]}]}],"to":"now","references":[],"version":9,"exceptions_list":[],"immutable":false,"related_integrations":[],"required_fields":[],"setup":"","type":"eql","language":"eql","index":["auditbeat-*","logs-system.auth-*"],"query":"sequence by host.id, source.ip, user.name with maxspan=2m\n  [authentication where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.action  in (\"ssh_login\", \"user_login\") and\n   event.outcome == \"failure\" and source.ip != null and source.ip != \"0.0.0.0\" and source.ip != \"::\" ] with runs=10\n\n  [authentication where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.action  in (\"ssh_login\", \"user_login\") and\n   event.outcome == \"success\" and source.ip != null and source.ip != \"0.0.0.0\" and source.ip != \"::\" ]\n","filters":[],"actions":[{"group":"default","id":"446e2d20-c554-11ee-a7fc-855e12ead1d4","params":{"documents":[{"context_alerts":"[{{context.alerts}}]","name":"{{context.rule.name}}","alert_type":"ssh_brute_force","link":"{{rule.url}}","email_intro":"SSH brute force attempts on these machines","query":"{{context.rule.query}}","params":"{{rule.params}}","rule_date":"{{date}}"}]},"action_type_id":".index","uuid":"5534c2b6-8d40-4cbd-be2e-3ca9d8c046c2","frequency":{"notifyWhen":"onActiveAlert","throttle":null,"summary":true}}]}
